# Parallelization

## Parallel tests

> This feature is under experiment.

Cytorus relies on [sorry-cypress](https://sorry-cypress.dev/) to run tests in parallel. Hence, [cy2](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/cy2) must be added as dependency in your project.

```bash
cd cytorus-repo
npm install cy2
export CYPRESS_API_URL="http://localhost:1234/"
npx cytorus run -p true
```

Also set `"projectId"` in cypress.json.

Remember to run sorry-cypress director before you start tests using following command

```bash
docker run -d --rm  -p 1234:1234 agoldis/sorry-cypress-director:2.0.0-beta.12
```

-d: to run docker container in background
-rm: remove container on exit

Note that the host and port are matching with `CYPRESS_API_URL`.

ðŸ’¡ ***You can pull docker image in advance on the machine used to run tests in CI/CD pipelines to reduce runtime***

 If you're running the Cytorus locally, you may not want to run tests in parallel. In this case, you can avoid running sorry-cypress director. But ensure that you're not setting `CYPRESS_API_URL`.

```bash
unset CYPRESS_API_URL
```

***Controlling number of parallel runs***

Either you can set Cytorus to run multiple instances in the same window using `-p true` or open multiple CLI windows and run Cytorus using `--cy2` argument.

### Troubleshooting

1. Please ensure that you're running **sorry-cypress-director:2.0.0-beta.12** or higher
2. If you're not running sorry-cypress director, don't run tests in parallel.
3. If you're not running sorry-cypress director, don't set CYPRESS_API_URL env variable
