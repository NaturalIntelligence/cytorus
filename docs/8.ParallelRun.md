# Parallel tests
> This feature is under experiment.

Cytorus relies on [sorry-cypress]() to run tests in parallel. Hence, [cy2](https://github.com/sorry-cypress/cy2) must be added as dependency in your project.

```bash
$ cd cytorus-repo
$ npm install cy2
$ export CYPRESS_API_URL="http://localhost:1234/"
$ npx cytorus run -p true
```
Also set `"projectId"` in cypress.json.

Remember to run sorry-cypress director befor you start tests using following command;
```bash
$ docker run -d --rm  -p 1234:1234 agoldis/sorry-cypress-director:2.0.0-beta.12
```
-d: to run docker container in background
-rm: remove container on exit

Note that the host and port are matching with `CYPRESS_API_URL`.

<small>ðŸ’¡You can pull docker image in advance on the machine used to run tests in CI/CD pipelines to reduce runtime.</small>

If you're running the cytorus locally, you may not want to run tests in parallel. In this case, you can avoid running sorry-cypress director. But ensure that you're not setting `CYPRESS_API_URL`.

```bash
unset CYPRESS_API_URL
```
## Controlling number of parallel runs

Either you can set cytorus to run multiple instances in the same window using `-p true` or open multiple CLI windows and run cytorus using `--cy2` argument.

# Troubleshooting

1. Please ensure that you're running **sorry-cypress-director:2.0.0-beta.12** or higher
2. If you're not running sorry-cypress director, don't run tests in parallel.
3. If you're not running sorry-cypress director, don't set CYPRESS_API_URL env variable
