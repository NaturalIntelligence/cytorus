## Scenario Context

You can set `SC` (Scenario Context) from any step definition.

```js
step('set scenario context', ()=>{
    SC.someVar = "some value"
})
step('check scenario context', ()=>{
    console.log(SC.someVar) //some value
})
```

This helps to communicate between the steps. `SC` reset for each scenario.

```feature
Scenario: Make an order from home page
    Given I'm on home page
    #Save order detail in scenario context
    When I add following items in the cart
    | pizza | Farm House  |
    | extra_toppings   | onion,paneer |
    #Validate the cart from the order detail in scenario context
    Then I can see the cart with selected items
```

Scenario Context can be used to write 
* generic steps and avoid writing vague, similar, technical steps.
* steps that can be used for different context, just like polymorphism.
