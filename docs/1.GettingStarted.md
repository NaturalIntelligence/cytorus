# Getting Started

## Pre-requisite

1. Install [Nodejs v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Project Setup

1. Clone or download [cytorus-boilerplate](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/cytorus-boilerplate).
2. Run `npm install` in root folder

To run tests in parallel, you'll need a few more dependencies so follow [parallel run](./8.ParallelRun.md) configuration.

## Directory Structure

Cytorus relies on Cypress. Hence, it uses the same directory structure.

```markdown
ProjectRoot
    |__cypress
    |        |___ fixtures
    |        |___ integration
    |                |___ features
    |                |___ steps
    |        |___ plugins
    |        |___ reports
    |        |___ screenshots
    |        |___ support
    |__package.json
    |__cypress.json
    |__cytorus.config.js
```

Cytorus reads feature files from `cypress/integration/features` folder. However,  step definitions can exist anywhere inside `cypress/integration/` folder.

### cypress.json

You need this minimum configuration in **cypress.json**

```json
{
    "projectId": "of-your-wish", //for parallel run
    "ignoreTestFiles": ["*.js","*.ts", "*.d_ts", "*.json", "*.xml"],
}
```

#### cytorus.config.json

It is optional. But check [configuration](ProjectConfiguration.md) that you can set to use more features from Cytorus.
