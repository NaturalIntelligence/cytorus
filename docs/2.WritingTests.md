# Writing Tests

## Feature Files

Cytorus uses [cucumon](https://github.com/NaturalIntelligence/cucumon/) to parse feature file. It means you can write feature files Gherkin syntax with some additional features.

```gherkin
#!
Feature: I can order a Pizza

Rule: Explore available products

Scenario: Display Trendy Pizzas
    #> route: home page; story: US002
    Given I'm on home page
    Then I should see the top selling pizzas

@wip
Scenario: Display Side dishes
    #> route: home page; story: US001
    Given I'm on home page
    Then I should see the list of side dishes

Rule: Find relevant products

@skip
Scenario: Search for a pizza
    #> story: US003
    Given I'm on any page
    When I search for "cheese"
    Then it should result all pizzas
    When I search for "mushroom"
    Then it should result following pizzas
    #>[]
    | Farm House |
    | Deluxe Veggie |
    | Veg Extravaganza |

Rule: Create a cart

Scenario: Make an order from home page
    #> route: home page; story: US004
    Given I'm on home page
    #Save order detail in scenario context
    When I add following items in the cart
    #> {}
    | pizza | Farm House  |
    | extra_toppings   | onion,paneer |
    #Validate the cart from the order detail in scenario context
    Then I can see the cart with selected items
```

* `#!` in the starting of the file to skip the file from processing
* `#> route: ...` will help to run tests for a particular page or from a particular page.
* `#> story: ...` will help to run tests for a particular user story
* `#>[]` To transform a data table into and array for better readability and accessibility in the code. Followings are supported;
  * `#>[]`: To array
  * `#>{}`: To Object
  * `#>[{}]`: To list of objects

## Step Definitions

You can write step definition in any js files inside `cypress/integration` folder. You can use string, cucumber expression or regular expression for a step definition.

```js
/// <reference types="cypress" />

//import { Given, When, Then, And, But, step} from "cytorus/src/Globals"

Given("This is normal string", function () {
});

When("This is cucumber expression with {parameter}", function (parameter){
});

step(/you can also use regex "(.*)"/, (parameter) => {
});
```

For better performance

* If possible, use string to create a step definitions.

```js
step("This is a string", () => {})
```

* If you're using regex, then use `^` in starting.

```js
step(/^This is a (.*)/, () => {})
```
