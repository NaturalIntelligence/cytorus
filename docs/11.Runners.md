# Test Runner

## Test Runner Modes

Cytorus provides you multiple ways to run tests using cypress

- Using `cypress`: When you want to run tests by installing cypress locally.
- Using `cy2`: When you want to run tests in parallel using sorry-cypress.
- Using cypress docker image: When you want to run tests using the cypress image.

Check [Parallel Run Section](./8.ParallelRun.md) to know how to use locally installed cypress or cy2.

To use cypress docker image

1. Install docker and fetch cypress docker image in advance to avoid delay in running tests;

```docker
docker pull cypress/included:8.3.1
```

`8.3.1` is cypress version. We recommend to use latest cypress version.

Do necessary docker settings in cytorus.config.js

```js
module.exports = {
    runConfig: {
        docker: {
            //env: [ "CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY",  "CYPRESS_VIDEO" ],
            // args : {
            //     "--network": "host"
            // },
            // "cypress" : "8.3.1",
        }
    }
}
```

Pass `--docker` to run tests using docker cypress image

```bash
npx cytorus run --docker --spec "cypress/integration/features/**/*.feature"
```
